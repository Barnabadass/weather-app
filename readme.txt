This is a weather app that shows the current weather and a 5-day forecast.
By default, it shows the weather for the user`s current location, but it is 
possible to type the name of the desired location or just point to it on the map.
The color scheme and temperature units can be changed in the menu.
The app is made with Typescript, React and Redux. 
The weather data is received via the openweathermap.org API.
